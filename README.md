 The following information is available:
• Non-current assets contain land and
   buildings that are valued $700,000 above
   their book value, and plant and machinery,
   which would sell for $200,000 less than
   their book value.
• Inventory would sell for $400,000 and only
   $250,000 would be realized from
   receivables.
• Closure costs would add $100,000 to
   liabilities.
